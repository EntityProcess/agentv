Add TypeScript SDK for code judge evaluators with type-safe camelCase API. The SDK provides `readCodeJudgePayload()` and `parseCodeJudgePayload()` functions that automatically convert snake_case wire format to idiomatic camelCase TypeScript, along with a `CodeJudgePayload` interface for compile-time type safety.
