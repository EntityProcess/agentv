## Implementation Notes

**Error Handling**: Validates input type, checks for empty lists, and ensures all elements are integers. Returns `None` when fewer than 2 unique numbers exist.

**Algorithm**: Removes duplicates with `set()`, sorts descending, and returns the second element. Prioritizes clarity over performance.
