# Example .agentv/config.yaml Configuration

# Customize which files are treated as guidelines vs regular file content
# using glob patterns. If this file is not present, AgentV uses default patterns.

# Default patterns (used when this file is absent):
# - "**/*.instructions.md"
# - "**/instructions/**"
# - "**/*.prompt.md"  
# - "**/prompts/**"

# Custom guideline patterns:
guideline_patterns:
  - "**/*.instructions.md"
  - "**/*.prompt.md"
  - "**/SKILL.md"

# Notes:
# - Patterns use standard glob syntax (via micromatch library)
# - Paths are normalized to forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility
# - Only files matching these patterns are loaded as guidelines
# - All other files referenced in eval cases are treated as regular file content
