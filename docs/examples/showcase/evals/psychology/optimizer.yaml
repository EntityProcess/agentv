# ACE Optimization Configuration Example
# Defines how to optimize prompts using the ACE (Automatic Cognitive Enhancement) framework

description: ACE optimization

# Optimization framework type
type: ace

# Eval files to use for optimization
# ACE will run these evals to measure prompt performance and guide improvements
# Use eval files designed with explicit reasoning prompts for best ACE results
eval_files:
  - dataset.yaml

# ACE playbook configuration
# Defines the optimization strategy and constraints
playbook_path: playbook.json

# Maximum optimization iterations across ALL eval cases
max_epochs: 5

# Allow ACE to create new sections in the prompt
# When true, ACE can add new instructions/guidelines
# When false, ACE can only modify existing content
allow_dynamic_sections: true

# Optional: Filter which eval cases to include
# filters:
#   conversation_ids:
#     - python-code-generation
#   eval_case_ids:
#     - code-gen-python-comprehensive

# Optional: Target override for optimization runs
# target: azure_base

# Optional: Stop early if success rate exceeds threshold
# early_stopping:
#   metric: success_rate
#   threshold: 0.95
