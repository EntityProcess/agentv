## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Document canonical code_judge wire payload (snake_case, no new envelope)
- [x] 1.2 Add wire payload fixtures/examples and validation notes
- [x] 1.3 Add optional TS helper module with camelCase types + parse/serialize helpers
  - Created `packages/core/src/evaluation/code-judge-sdk.ts`
  - Exports: `CodeJudgePayload` type, `parseCodeJudgePayload()`, `readCodeJudgePayload()`
  - Internal: `toCamelCaseDeep()` and `toSnakeCaseDeep()` for conversion
- [x] 1.4 Keep core payload emission aligned with the canonical snake_case shape
  - Core uses `toSnakeCaseDeep()` when sending to code judges
- [x] 1.5 Add tests for payload compatibility and TS helper round-trip conversions
  - Integration test: `packages/core/test/evaluation/evaluators.test.ts`
  - Test fixture: `packages/core/test/fixtures/test-sdk-judge.ts`
  - Feature example: `examples/features/code-judge-sdk/`
