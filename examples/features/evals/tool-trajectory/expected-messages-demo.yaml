# AgentV Expected Messages Tool Calls Demo
# Demonstrates the expected_messages evaluator for validating tool_calls against traces
#
# The expected_messages evaluator extracts tool_calls from assistant messages in
# expected_messages and validates them sequentially against the actual trace.
#
# This is an alternative pattern to tool_trajectory for when you want to specify
# expected tool calls inline with the conversation flow.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Create examples/features/.env with:
#      TOOL_TRAJECTORY_DIR=/absolute/path/to/examples/features/evals/tool-trajectory
#   2. Run: cd examples/features && npx agentv eval evals/tool-trajectory/expected-messages-demo.yaml --target mock_agent

evalcases:
  # ==========================================
  # Example 1: Basic tool_calls validation
  # Use case: Validate specific tools were called in order
  # The mock agent triggers "research" scenario with knowledgeSearch and documentRetrieve
  # Expected score: 1.0 (all tool_calls match)
  # ==========================================
  - id: basic-tool-calls-match
    expected_outcome: |-
      Agent searches the knowledge base and retrieves documents.

    input_messages:
      - role: user
        content: Research the key differences between REST and GraphQL APIs.

    # Specify expected tool_calls in expected_messages
    expected_messages:
      - role: assistant
        content: I'll research this topic for you.

  # ==========================================
  # Example 2: Validate with input matching
  # Use case: Ensure specific inputs are passed to tools
  # The mock agent triggers "metrics" scenario
  # Expected score: 1.0 if inputs match exactly
  # ==========================================
  - id: tool-calls-with-input
    expected_outcome: |-
      Agent retrieves CPU and memory metrics for the production server.

    input_messages:
      - role: user
        content: What are the current system metrics for CPU and memory?

    expected_messages:
      - role: assistant
        content: I'll check the system metrics.
        tool_calls:
          - tool: getCpuMetrics

  # ==========================================
  # Example 3: Data pipeline workflow
  # Use case: Validate multi-step data processing workflow
  # The mock agent triggers "data pipeline" scenario
  # Expected score: 1.0 (all 4 tools match in order)
  # ==========================================
  - id: pipeline-tool-calls
    expected_outcome: |-
      Agent follows the complete data processing pipeline.

    input_messages:
      - role: user
        content: Process the customer data from the API endpoint.

    expected_messages:
      - role: assistant

  # ==========================================
  # Example 4: Authentication flow
  # Use case: Validate security-critical tool sequence
  # The mock agent triggers "auth" scenario
  # Expected score: 1.0 (exact sequence match)
  # ==========================================
  - id: auth-tool-calls
    expected_outcome: |-
      Agent performs authentication steps in correct order.

    input_messages:
      - role: user
        content: Authenticate the user with provided credentials.

    expected_messages:
      - role: assistant

  # ==========================================
  # Example 5: Partial match - wrong tool
  # Use case: Demonstrate scoring when tool names don't match
  # The mock agent triggers "research" scenario but we expect different tools
  # Expected score: ~0.33 (1 of 3 matches - documentRetrieve present but position differs)
  # ==========================================
  - id: partial-match-wrong-tool
    expected_outcome: |-
      Agent uses different tools than expected.

    input_messages:
