      Provide a clear explanation of how quicksort works, including time complexity

          Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm:
          
          1. Choose a pivot element from the array
          2. Partition: rearrange elements so smaller values are on the left, larger on the right
          3. Recursively apply quicksort to the left and right partitions
          
          Time Complexity:
          - Best/Average: O(n log n)
          - Worst case: O(n²) when poorly chosen pivots

    # Inline rubrics - simple string format
    rubrics:
      - Mentions divide-and-conquer approach
      - Explains the partition step
      - States time complexity correctly

  # Example 2: Detailed rubric objects

          Climate change is accelerating faster than predicted. Recent studies show
          Arctic ice melting at unprecedented rates, sea levels rising, and extreme
          weather events becoming more frequent. Scientists urge immediate action to
          reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources.

          Climate change accelerates with rapid Arctic ice loss and rising seas.
          Extreme weather increases. Scientists call for urgent carbon emission
          cuts and renewable energy adoption.
