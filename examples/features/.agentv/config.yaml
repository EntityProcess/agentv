# Example .agentv/config.yaml Configuration

# Customize which files are treated as guidelines vs regular file content
# using glob patterns. If this file is not present, AgentV uses default patterns.

# Custom guideline patterns:
guideline_patterns:
  - "**/*.instructions.md"
  - "**/*.prompt.md"
  - "**/SKILL.md"

# Customize which YAML files are discovered as evals during interactive mode
# (`agentv run` with no args). Defaults to dataset*.yaml and eval.yaml under evals/.
eval_patterns:
  - "**/evals/**/dataset*.yaml"
  - "**/evals/**/eval.yaml"

# Notes:
# - Patterns use standard glob syntax (via fast-glob)
# - Matching is case-insensitive
# - Only files matching these patterns are discovered in interactive mode
# - All other files referenced in eval cases are treated as regular file content
