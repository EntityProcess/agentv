# Invoice Extraction Evaluation Dataset
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: This example uses the proposed `field_accuracy` evaluator from
# OpenSpec proposal 'add-structured-data-evaluators'. It will not run until that
# proposal is implemented. See: openspec/changes/add-structured-data-evaluators/
#
# This eval tests a mock invoice extractor's ability to extract structured trade data
# from commercial invoices, including header fields, party details, line items, and totals.
#
# Use case: Document processing pipeline that ingests shipping invoices,
# extracts structured data, and displays it in a web UI.
#
# Evaluation approach:
# - Field-level accuracy with exact matching for invoice numbers and dates
# - Numeric tolerance for currency amounts (handles rounding)
# - Fuzzy matching for company names (handles spacing variations like "Acme - Shipping" vs "Acme Shipping")
#
# AgentV High-Level Goals Alignment:
# ✅ Declarative Definitions - Uses YAML with clear expected outcomes
# ✅ Structured Evaluation - Demonstrates deterministic field comparison (primitive for rubric-based)
# ⚠️  Multi-Objective Scoring - Currently only correctness; latency/cost/safety planned
# ✅ Optimization Ready - Weighted fields enable future hyperparameter tuning

    outcome: |
      Extractor produces clean data matching expected ground truth.
      Mock extractor rounds supplier name from "Acme - Shipping" to "Acme Shipping" in HTML.
      All numeric values rounded to integers (1889 not 1889.00).
      Tests that exact matching passes when extractor normalizes data correctly.
