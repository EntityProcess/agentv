# Document Extraction Evaluation Dataset
#
# This eval tests a mock invoice extractor's ability to extract structured trade data
# from commercial invoices, including header fields, party details, line items, and totals.
#
# Use case: Document processing pipeline that ingests shipping invoices,
# extracts structured data, and displays it in a web UI.
#
# Evaluation approach:
# - Field-level accuracy with exact matching for invoice numbers and currency codes
# - Date matching with format normalization (handles "15-JAN-2025" vs "2025-01-15")
# - Numeric tolerance for currency amounts (handles rounding)
# - For fuzzy matching (OCR variations), use code_judge with fuzzy_match.ts
#
# AgentV High-Level Goals Alignment:
# ✅ Declarative Definitions - Uses YAML with clear expected outcomes
# ✅ Structured Evaluation - Demonstrates deterministic field comparison (primitive for rubric-based)
# ✅ Lightweight Core - Geometric evaluators deferred to code_judge plugins
# ✅ Optimization Ready - Weighted fields enable future hyperparameter tuning

    outcome: |
      Extractor produces clean data matching expected ground truth.
      Mock extractor rounds supplier name from "Acme - Shipping" to "Acme Shipping" in HTML.
      All numeric values rounded to integers (1889 not 1889.00).
      Tests that exact matching passes when extractor normalizes data correctly.
