# Contextual Recall Evaluator
#
# Evaluates whether retrieval context covers all statements in the expected answer.
# This metric identifies gaps where retrieval failed to surface needed information.
#
# Formula: Attributable Statements / Total Statements
#
# Process:
# 1. Extract distinct statements from criteria
# 2. Check if each statement can be attributed to retrieval context
# 3. Score = proportion of attributable statements
#
# Retrieval context is passed via expected_messages.tool_calls, which
# represents the expected agent behavior (calling a retrieval tool).
