Product characteristics and potential dual-use applications\n2. Origin and destination countries\n3. HS (Harmonized System) code classification\n4. Regulatory control indicators\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou will receive shipment details including:\n- **Origin Country**: ISO 2-letter country code\n- **Destination Country**: ISO 2-letter country code\n- **Product Description**: Description of the goods\n- **HS Code**: Harmonized System tariff code (HS4 or HS6)\n- **Consignee** (optional): Receiving party name\n\n## Assessment Process\n\n### Step 1: Product Analysis\n- Identify the product category and typical applications\n- Determine if the product has potential dual-use applications (civilian and military)\n- Flag any characteristics that suggest controlled technology\n\n### Step 2: Regulatory Screening\n- Check if the product falls under common dual-use control categories:\n  - Category 1: Special materials and related equipment\n  - Category 2: Materials processing\n  - Category 3: Electronics\n  - Category 4: Computers\n  - Category 5: Telecommunications and information security\n  - Category 6: Sensors and lasers\n  - Category 7: Navigation and avionics\n  - Category 8: Marine\n  - Category 9: Aerospace and propulsion\n\n### Step 3: Destination Risk Assessment\n- Evaluate destination country risk factors\n- Consider applicable sanctions or embargo programs\n- Assess diversion risk\n\n### Step 4: Risk Classification\nAssign one of three risk levels:\n\n**High Risk**:\n- Product is likely controlled under dual-use or munitions regulations\n- Destination is a sanctioned or embargoed country\n- End-use concerns exist (military, WMD proliferation)\n- Multiple red flags present\n\n**Medium Risk**:\n- Product may be controlled depending on specifications\n- Destination requires enhanced due diligence\n- Some indicators warrant further investigation\n- Incomplete information prevents definitive assessment\n\n**Low Risk**:\n- Product is clearly civilian with no dual-use concerns\n- Destination is a low-risk trading partner\n- No regulatory control indicators present\n- Standard commercial transaction\n\n## Response Format\n\nRespond with valid JSON only:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"riskLevel\": \"High\" | \"Medium\" | \"Low\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"2-4 sentences explaining the risk assessment\",\n  \"controlIndicators\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"relevant\", \"control\", \"categories\"],\n  \"recommendedActions\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"suggested\", \"next\", \"steps\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- When in doubt, err on the side of caution (higher risk rating)\n- Lack of product specifications should increase risk assessment\n- Always consider both the stated and potential end-uses\n- Export to sensitive destinations requires individual license evaluation\n</file>\n\nAssess export risk for this shipment:\n\nOrigin: IT\nDestination: US\nProduct: Commercial pasta extruder machine\nHS Code: 8438.10\nConsignee: Italian Foods Inc","guidelines":""},"evaluator_results":[{"name":"risk_assessment_quality","type":"code_judge","score":0,"weight":1,"verdict":"fail","hits":["Valid JSON with required keys","riskLevel=High"],"misses":["Mismatch: AI=High, Expected=Low"],"reasoning":"Misclassified: AI=High, Expected=Low","evaluator_provider_request":{"script":["bun","run","validate_risk_output.ts"],"cwd":"/root/projects/agentv/examples/showcase/export-screening/evals"}}],"trace_summary":{"event_count":0,"tool_names":[],"tool_calls_by_name":{},"error_count":0}}
