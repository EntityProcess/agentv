# Using Autopilot Dev

## Overview

Entry point skill that establishes the phase-based delivery lifecycle and enforces skill invocation discipline.

## Subagent Stop

If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill entirely.

## Lifecycle

```
ad-claim → ad-explore → ad-design → ad-plan → ad-implement → ad-verify → ad-ship
```

| Phase | Skill | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Claim | ad-claim | Claim issue, create worktree + branch + draft PR |
| Explore | ad-explore | Understand the codebase and problem space |
| Design | ad-design | Brainstorm approaches, write approved spec |
| Plan | ad-plan | Convert spec into bite-sized implementation plan |
| Implement | ad-implement | TDD execution with subagent dispatch |
| Verify | ad-verify | E2E red/green testing, code review, blast radius check |
| Ship | ad-ship | Mark PR ready, merge, clean up worktree |

## Phase Skip Rules

Not every change needs every phase:

- **Trivial changes** (< 5 lines, docs-only, config-only): claim → implement → verify → ship
- **Bug fixes with clear root cause**: claim → explore → implement → verify → ship
- **Well-specified issues** (full spec in issue body): claim → explore → plan → implement → verify → ship

When in doubt, do not skip phases. Skipping design on a "simple" change that turns out to be complex is more expensive than spending 5 minutes on design.

## The 1% Rule

If there is even a 1% chance a phase skill applies to the current task, invoke it. Check for applicable skills BEFORE any response or action — including clarifying questions.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP — you are rationalizing your way out of a phase:

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check the lifecycle. |
| "I need more context first" | That is what ad-explore does. |
| "Let me just write the code quickly" | That is what ad-implement does, with TDD. |
| "I can skip the design for this" | Every project needs a design, regardless of perceived simplicity. |
| "Tests are passing, we're done" | Unit tests ≠ verified. That is what ad-verify does. |
| "I'll clean up the PR later" | That is what ad-ship does, with blast radius checks. |
| "Let me explore the code first" | Use ad-explore — it has structured output. |
| "I know what needs to change" | Verify with ad-explore. Partial implementations may already exist. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply:

1. **Process skills first** (ad-explore, ad-design) — determine HOW to approach
2. **Execution skills second** (ad-implement, ad-verify) — guide what to do

"Let's build X" → ad-explore first, then ad-design, then ad-plan.
"Fix this bug" → ad-explore first, then ad-implement.

## Artifact Locations

All plan and design artifacts live on the worktree branch, not in the main repo tree:

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| Design specs | `.agents/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` |
| Implementation plans | `.agents/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md` |

## Configuration

The plugin reads conventions from the repo's CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and contributing guides. Repo guidelines always override plugin defaults. The plugin provides workflow discipline — project-specific concerns belong in the project's guidelines.
