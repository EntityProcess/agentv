# Customize which files are treated as guidelines vs regular file content

# Custom guideline patterns:
guideline_patterns:
  - "**/*.instructions.md"
  - "**/instructions/**"
  - "**/*.prompt.md"
  - "**/prompts/**"

# Notes:
# - Patterns use standard glob syntax (via micromatch library)
# - Paths are normalized to forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility
# - Only files matching these patterns are loaded as guidelines
# - All other files referenced in eval cases are treated as regular file content
