The `compare` command computes deltas between two evaluation runs for A/B testing.

## Usage

Run two evaluations and compare them:

```bash
agentv eval evals/my-eval.yaml --out before.jsonl
# ... make changes to your agent ...
agentv eval evals/my-eval.yaml --out after.jsonl
agentv compare before.jsonl after.jsonl
```

## Options

### Threshold

Set a minimum delta to highlight significant changes:

```bash
agentv compare before.jsonl after.jsonl --threshold 0.1
```

## Output

The comparison shows:

- **Wins** — cases where scores improved
- **Losses** — cases where scores regressed
- **Ties** — cases with no significant change
- **Mean delta** — average score change across all cases

This helps identify whether changes to your agent or prompts improved or regressed performance.
