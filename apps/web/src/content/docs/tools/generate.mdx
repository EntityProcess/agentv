The `generate` command creates structured evaluation criteria from your eval cases.

## Generate Rubrics

Auto-generate rubrics from expected outcomes:

```bash
agentv generate rubrics evals/my-eval.yaml
```

This analyzes each eval case's `expected_outcome` field and creates structured rubric criteria with appropriate weights.

## How It Works

1. Reads each eval case's `expected_outcome`
2. Uses an LLM to decompose the expected outcome into individual checkable criteria
3. Assigns weights based on importance
4. Writes the rubrics back to the eval file

## Example

Before:

```yaml
evalcases:
  - id: quicksort
    expected_outcome: Explains quicksort with time complexity and examples
    input: Explain quicksort
```

After running `agentv generate rubrics`:

```yaml
evalcases:
  - id: quicksort
    expected_outcome: Explains quicksort with time complexity and examples
    input: Explain quicksort
    rubrics:
      - Explains divide-and-conquer approach
      - Describes partition step
      - States O(n log n) average time complexity
      - Provides a concrete example
```
