The `generate` command creates structured evaluation criteria from your tests.

## Generate Rubrics

Auto-generate rubrics from expected outcomes:

```bash
agentv generate rubrics evals/my-eval.yaml
```

This analyzes each test's `criteria` field and creates structured rubric criteria with appropriate weights.

## How It Works

1. Reads each test's `criteria`
2. Uses an LLM to decompose the criteria into individual checkable rubric items
3. Assigns weights based on importance
4. Writes rubric criteria back under `assert: - type: rubrics`

## Example

Before:

```yaml
tests:
  - id: quicksort
    criteria: Explains quicksort with time complexity and examples
    input: Explain quicksort
```

After running `agentv generate rubrics`:

```yaml
tests:
  - id: quicksort
    criteria: Explains quicksort with time complexity and examples
    input: Explain quicksort
    assert:
      - type: rubrics
        criteria:
          - Explains divide-and-conquer approach
          - Describes partition step
          - States O(n log n) average time complexity
          - Provides a concrete example
```
