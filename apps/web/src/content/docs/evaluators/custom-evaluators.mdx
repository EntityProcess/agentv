AgentV supports multiple evaluator types that can be combined for comprehensive evaluation.

## Evaluator Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `code_judge` | Deterministic script (Python/TS/any) | Exact matching, format validation, programmatic checks |
| `llm_judge` | LLM-based evaluation with custom prompt | Semantic evaluation, nuance, subjective quality |
| Rubrics | Structured criteria in test | Multi-criterion grading with weights |

## Referencing Evaluators

Evaluators are configured at the execution level — either top-level (applies to all tests) or per-test:

### Top-Level (Default for All Tests)

```yaml
description: My evaluation
execution:
  evaluators:
    - name: correctness
      type: llm_judge
      prompt: ./judges/correctness.md

tests:
  - id: test-1
    # Uses the top-level evaluator
    ...
```

### Per-Case Override

```yaml
tests:
  - id: test-1
    criteria: Returns valid JSON
    input: Generate a JSON config
    execution:
      evaluators:
        - name: json_check
          type: code_judge
          script: ./validators/check_json.py
```

## Combining Evaluators

Use multiple evaluators on the same case for comprehensive scoring:

```yaml
tests:
  - id: code-generation
    criteria: Generates correct Python code
    input: Write a sorting function
    rubrics:
      - Code is syntactically valid
      - Handles edge cases (empty list, single element)
      - Uses appropriate algorithm
    execution:
      evaluators:
        - name: syntax_check
          type: code_judge
          script: ./validators/check_syntax.py
        - name: quality_review
          type: llm_judge
          prompt: ./judges/code_quality.md
```

Each evaluator produces its own score. Results appear in `scores[]` in the output JSONL.

## Best Practices

- **Use code judges for deterministic checks** — exact value matching, format validation, schema compliance
- **Use LLM judges for semantic evaluation** — meaning, quality, helpfulness
- **Use rubrics for structured multi-criteria grading** — when you need weighted, itemized scoring
- **Combine evaluator types** for comprehensive coverage
- **Test code judges locally** before running full evaluations
