## Run an Evaluation

```bash
agentv eval evals/my-eval.yaml
```

Results are written to `.agentv/results/eval_<timestamp>.jsonl`.

## Common Options

### Override Target

Run against a different target than specified in the eval file:

```bash
agentv eval --target azure_base evals/**/*.yaml
```

### Run Specific Eval Case

Run a single eval case by ID:

```bash
agentv eval --eval-id case-123 evals/my-eval.yaml
```

### Dry Run

Test the harness flow with mock responses (does not call real providers):

```bash
agentv eval --dry-run evals/my-eval.yaml
```

:::note
Dry-run returns mock responses that don't match evaluator output schemas. Use it only for testing harness flow, not evaluator logic.
:::

### Output to Specific File

```bash
agentv eval evals/my-eval.yaml --out results/baseline.jsonl
```

## Validate Before Running

Check eval files for schema errors without executing:

```bash
agentv validate evals/my-eval.yaml
```

## All Options

Run `agentv eval --help` for the full list of options including workers, timeouts, output formats, and trace dumping.
